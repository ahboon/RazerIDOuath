# RazerOuath2

Implemented Razer ID in a recent hackathon organized by Razer. Found no sample codes and I thought it would be great to share with people about how I implemneted it. Same concept as how Google OAuth is implemented, but a slight deviation. No external packages required. Purely done using built in libraries, with the exception of "github.com/gorilla/mux" being used to serve the service.
